# New Repository Template

This is a starter template for creating new repositories/projects.
Project structure is designed for tests.

- Compatible with Windows - for those who can't use Mac at work (like me)

- Sample code for tests included - using the built-in unittest class. Not pytests, unfortunately, since I also can't install that on my work computer :(
